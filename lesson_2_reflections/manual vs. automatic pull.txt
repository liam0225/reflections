manual vs. automatic pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually help to keep files and commits up to date and it gives you the flexibility to decide when you want the file if a file is not complete you dont have to pull it until you are ready.
