staging area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temp locations where files can be added to work on before a commit is made and without altering the original file. The value of it is that is will not alter the original file and give you access to mofifying the file.

how can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You cand use the staging area to compare files use git diff and git diff --staged which let you compare your stage area with your working directory and your first commit to the staging area. That way you can compare files and see that you are making sure you have one logical commit per change.
